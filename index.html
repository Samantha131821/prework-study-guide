        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Metadata in the head element is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>  
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage</li>
          <li>The src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head,</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>When we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file. Just because our files are in the same project repository doesn’t mean they know about each other. To do this, we will use the HTML link element.</li>
          <li>The head section is where we store metadata, which contains information about the webpage. This is where we will add the link to our style sheet.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>We use the add -A command to commit all files in the working branch.</li>
          <li>We use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented. Once completed, our Git repository is now up to date with our working directory!</li>
          <li>git pull origin main. It is a good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code.</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/add-html</li>

       <h2>JavaScript</h2>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
       feature/project-README
        
       
          <li>>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name</li>
          <li>we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks</li>
          <li>We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li>Use === in each condition. The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ().The code to be executed is written inside the curly brackets {}. We want this function to log a string to the console. We add the console.log method with the text that we want logged in the console.</li>
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
